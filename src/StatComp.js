        <p>In the future, this tab will be the home to a player stat comparison visualizer. 
          You will be able to input any two given players names, and it will return a side by side
          comparison of the players stats in a graph. This section is currently being worked on,
          and may be implemented in waves of updates. This may take a while to fully deploy so 
          in the mean time, enjoy the other pages of analysis that also have much more on the way!
